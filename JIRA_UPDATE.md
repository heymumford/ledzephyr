- Simplified Makefile to essentials
- Prepared for Rovo AI automation

## ðŸš§ Current State

### Codebase Status
- **5,780 lines** of Python code in src/ledzephyr/
- **Large files** needing refactoring:
  - exporters.py (726 lines)
  - error_handler.py (533 lines)
  - validators.py (523 lines)
- **Unused modules** to evaluate:
  - adoption_metrics.py
  - adoption_report.py
  - identity_resolution.py
  - training_impact.py
  - migrate_specs/ package

### Technical Debt
- Test coverage at 53.6% (target: 60%+)
- Multiple linting issues (ruff, mypy, bandit)
- Complex error handling patterns
- Overengineered validation logic

## ðŸ“‹ New Jira Work Items Needed

### Epic: Code Cleanup & Refactoring
**Goal**: Achieve lean, maintainable codebase

#### Story 1: Remove Unused Modules
- Evaluate adoption_* modules
- Remove migrate_specs if not needed
- Update imports and dependencies

#### Story 2: Simplify Complex Files
- Refactor exporters.py (split or simplify)
- Streamline error_handler.py
- Simplify validators.py

#### Story 3: Fix Linting & Type Issues
- Resolve all ruff warnings
- Fix mypy type annotations
- Address bandit security findings

### Epic: Platform Automation Setup
**Goal**: Full Jira-GitHub/GitLab integration

#### Story 1: Jira Automation Rules
- Create webhook receivers
- Set up smart commit parsing
- Configure status transitions

#### Story 2: GitHub/GitLab Integration
- Connect repositories to Jira
- Set up bidirectional sync
- Configure merge request linking

#### Story 3: Rovo AI Agent Configuration
- Documentation sync agent
- Metrics collection agent
- Test orchestration agent

### Epic: Achieve Pure Code Base
**Goal**: Only essential, high-quality code remains

#### Story 1: Core Functionality Focus
- Keep only migration metrics code
- Remove feature creep additions
- Maintain lean architecture

#### Story 2: Test Coverage Improvement
- Achieve 60%+ coverage
- Focus on critical paths
- Remove redundant tests

#### Story 3: Documentation as Code
- All docs in Confluence
- Code self-documenting
- Minimal README only

## ðŸŽ¯ Priority Order

1. **Immediate**: Code cleanup (remove unused)
2. **Next Sprint**: Simplify complex files
3. **Following Sprint**: Platform automation
4. **Future**: Continuous improvement

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Lines of Code | 5,780 | <3,000 |
| File Count | 20+ | <15 |
| Coverage | 53.6% | 60%+ |
| Max File Size | 726 | <300 |
| Documentation Files | 4 | 3 |

## ðŸ”„ Next Actions

1. Update LED-46 epic with current status
2. Close completed tasks (LED-47 to LED-51 if done)
3. Create new stories for code cleanup
4. Set up automation epic
5. Prioritize backlog for next sprint
