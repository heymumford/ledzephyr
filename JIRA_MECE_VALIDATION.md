# MECE Validation Checklist for Jira Work Items

## ‚úÖ Mutually Exclusive Validation

### Epic Level - No Overlaps
- [x] **Data Foundation** (Epic 1) - Only handles raw data ingestion and storage
  - Does NOT include: identity matching, metrics calculation, or visualization
- [x] **Identity Resolution** (Epic 2) - Only handles entity matching
  - Does NOT include: data fetching or metric calculation
- [x] **Adoption Metrics** (Epic 3) - Only calculates metrics from matched data
  - Does NOT include: training logic or report generation

### Story Level - Clear Boundaries
Each story has been validated to ensure:
- No duplicate functionality across stories

## üìä Dependency Analysis

### No Circular Dependencies ‚úì
```
Data Layer ‚Üí Identity Layer ‚Üí Metrics Layer ‚Üí Intelligence Layer ‚Üí Presentation Layer
     ‚Üì            ‚Üì                ‚Üì                ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
Operations & Monitoring (cuts across all layers but doesn't create cycles)
```

### Critical Path Identified ‚úì
1. LZ-102 (Schema) - Blocks everything
2. LZ-201 (Canonical IDs) - Blocks identity resolution
3. LZ-202 (Crosswalk) - Blocks accurate metrics
4. LZ-301 (Core Metrics) - Blocks intelligence
5. LZ-401 (Scoring) - Blocks recommendations
6. LZ-404 (Recommendations) - Blocks training report
7. LZ-502 (Training Report) - Final deliverable

## üéØ Business Value Mapping

### Each Epic Maps to Distinct Value
| Epic | Business Value | No Overlap With |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Data Foundation | Enables all analytics | Other epics provide logic, not data |
| Identity Resolution | Ensures accuracy (95% target) | Others assume matching is done |
| Adoption Metrics | Provides visibility | Others use metrics, don't calculate |
| Training Intelligence | Optimizes $500K budget | Others report, don't optimize |
| Reporting | Enables decisions | Others generate data, not presentations |
| Operations | Ensures reliability (99.9% SLA) | Others assume system is running |

## üìè Sizing Validation

### Story Points Distribution
- **Smallest**: 3 points (well-defined, low risk)
- **Largest**: 8 points (complex, higher risk)
- **No story > 8 points** (properly decomposed)
- **Total**: 91 points across 20 stories

### Sprint Capacity
- **Average**: 15 points per sprint
- **6 sprints total** at 2 weeks each = 12 weeks
- **Buffer**: 10% capacity reserved for bugs/support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks & Mitigations
1. **Identity matching < 95% accuracy**
   - Mitigation: Manual override capability (LZ-202)
   - Fallback: Human review queue

2. **Training recommendations rejected**
   - Mitigation: Explainable scores (LZ-401)
   - Fallback: A/B testing framework

3. **Data pipeline failures**
   - Mitigation: Retry logic & monitoring (LZ-103, LZ-601)
   - Fallback: Manual data loads

4. **Stakeholder adoption**
   - Mitigation: Executive summary (LZ-503)
   - Fallback: Change management included

## üèÅ Final MECE Certification
