## Manual Update Procedures

### Jira Updates
1. **Authenticate**: Use provided token to access balabushka.atlassian.net
2. **Project Navigation**: Go to LED project
3. **Bulk Update**: Use JQL queries to find and update items:
   ```jql
   project = LED AND status != DONE
   ```
4. **Status Changes**: Move completed items to DONE with comments
5. **Documentation Links**: Add links to GitHub documentation
6. **Security References**: Reference CVE remediation and security framework

### Confluence Updates
1. **Space Access**: Navigate to LedZephyr space
2. **Page Creation**: Create page hierarchy as outlined
3. **Content Migration**: Copy content from local documentation files
4. **Cross-linking**: Add internal links between pages
5. **GitHub Integration**: Add workflow status widgets where possible
6. **Permissions**: Set appropriate view/edit permissions

## Automated Sync Opportunities

### GitHub Actions Integration
- Workflow status badges in Confluence
- Automated documentation updates from README changes
- Test result reporting to Confluence
- Security scan result publishing

### Jira Integration
- Automated work item updates from commits
- GitHub Actions workflow results posted to tickets
- Performance metrics integration
- Security scan results linked to tickets

## Verification Steps

### Post-Update Verification
1. **Jira Consistency**: All work items reflect current state
2. **Confluence Accuracy**: Documentation matches implementation
3. **Cross-references**: Links between systems work correctly
4. **Permissions**: Access controls properly configured
5. **Integration**: Automated sync functionality working
