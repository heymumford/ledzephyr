# Documentation Streamlined

## What Remains (Essential Only)

- **README.md**: Install, usage, config (28 lines)
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Setup, development, standards (39 lines)
- **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**: Layer structure and validation (23 lines)

## What Was Removed

- `docs/coding-standards.md` (500+ lines)
- `docs/development/micro-practices.md` (300+ lines)
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (400+ lines)
- `docs/architecture/ADR-*.md` (4 files, 1500+ lines total)

## Governance Preserved

All enforcement mechanisms remain active:
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks working
- ✅ Architecture scripts working
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD working
- ✅ Property-based tests working

**Total reduction**: ~2700 lines → ~90 lines (97% reduction)

The codebase maintains all quality controls while removing verbose documentation.
